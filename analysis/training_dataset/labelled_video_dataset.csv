Building a web Application Programming Interface (API) traditionally involves a significant amount of work: defining routes, writing functions to fetch and shape data, ensuring a consistent interface, documenting the API, and more.

GraphQL, an open source alternative framework for fetching data over HTTP, seeks to reduce much of the overhead of building more traditional web APIs. All data from a web service is provided at a single endpoint, and consumers can discover data schemas to then build and run queries to get only the data they need. The result is faster and more efficient development experience in many aspects of building and consuming the data layer.

In this talk, I'll teach you what you need to know about Big-O, and how to use it to keep your programs running well.  Big-O helps you choose the data structures and algorithms that will let your code work efficiently even on large data sets.

You can understand Big-O even if you aren't a theoretical computer science math nerd. Big-O isn't as mystical as it appears. It's wrapped in mathematical trappings, but doesn't have to be more than a common-sense assessment of how your code will behave.

Some traits come more easily to mind than others when it comes to identifying a great developer. In this talk we will take a slightly different approach to evaluating software development best practices, and identify one underrated skill common to great software developers: empathy. I hope to demonstrate that cognitive and emotional empathy skills are critical to good software development. We will explore ways to cultivate this trait in order to become better developers, both for our own sakes and for the sake of the teams in which we work.

Are you interested in seeing how Kubernetes stands up to the record-breaking viewership and a login rate that is beyond belief on Game of Thrones Season 7 premiere? Come and see things we have done for the Game of Thrones preparation. We will talk about how we provision Kubernetes clusters on AWS, and how we monitor them and microservices that are running on the clusters.

In this talk, we will also go over how HBO Go went from deploying and running microservices on virtual machines in AWS EC2 to running the very same services inside the Kubernetes clusters. We were able to dramatically increase the productivity of our engineering teams and efficiency of resource utilization in the process. It wasn’t always a smooth ride and it wasn’t a one shot deal. Instead, it was a long and at times challenging journey starting from operating a reliable, production-ready Kubernetes cluster in AWS, advancing to gradually deploying select services into Kubernetes clusters, load testing them, and running them in parallel to our current EC2 installations, and finally going live. Come and learn some helpful tips and mistakes we made along the way, which could help your organization embrace the Kubernetes world.

I have been teaching myself to code for almost a year now. I initially started from Freecodecamp.com and other tutorials, the more I learn about web technologies like javascript the more I want to learn lower level languages like c++. A part of me wants to go back to college and study computer science. I have done a little research and many seem to say that it is not necessary but I want be marketable for a career in software development. I have read that the industry is being flooded with junior developers that don't know enough to be productive so I suppose that is why I think I need to go back to school. I had been applying to companies that fit my skill set and I haven't received one response regarding an interview.
I would really appreciate your advice on whether I should bite the bullet and go back to college or keep getting better at javascript and web technologies ie react, angular...

I am really keen on getting some React JS experience but anywhere I apply to, they seek an experienced React engineer. I have learn React on my own and recruiters do not seem to appreciate it. Further, at this stage at the big companies, I reach 1-2 rounds behind the final round and then they say they found a more experienced person for the role. Recently I got a rejection from the [COMPANY X] and [COMPANY Y . These both required 5-6 years of industry experience. My application took me to the initial rounds and they seemed interested in gauging my potential - only to find I was not as good as somebody they were looking for.
Next week I am appearing for a full stack role at [COMPANY Z] but it is clearly out of my league - they are seeking at least 6 years experience in JavaScript. I am pursuing it for interview experience + what if it works out somehow?
I do not know many people who can refer me. How do I get my first React job [without any industry experience]?
